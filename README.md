## 👨‍💻 Who I Am

I’m a junior developer currently focused on **front-end development** through the ALX Software Engineering program. I come from a background of youth advocacy and community engagement, and I’m now bringing that same energy into tech — with a mission to build digital experiences that are inclusive, accessible, and meaningful.

What drives me is simple: **tech should work for everyone.**

My passion for learning has led me to explore everything from clean code to command-line tools like piping, and I document what I learn so others can benefit too. I believe that even the smallest project, if done with intention, can create impact.

---

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

- Building responsive, accessible web interfaces with **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**
- Understanding how the **terminal works**, including topics like piping and redirection
- Writing clean, reusable code and organizing files professionally
- Exploring **data science** alongside front-end development

---

## 💡 What Inspires Me

- Creating tools that empower marginalized communities
- Teaching others what I’m learning in simple, clear language
- Designing solutions that solve real-world problems in health, education, and equality
- Making sure no one is left behind in the digital revolution

---

## 🔭 Projects I Want to Work On

- Front-end websites that promote **digital inclusion & gender equality**
- Beginner-friendly tech resources and guides (especially for those new to coding)
- Community or youth-focused digital platforms
- Data-driven tools that visualize social issues
